# Adjacency matrix

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix)

* Space complexity: O(|V|²).
* Time complexity:
    * Test if an edge is in the graph: O(1).
    * Find the degree of a vertex: O(|V|), or O(1) if a counter is kept for each vertex.
    * Insert or delete an edge: O(1).
    * Traverse the graph: O(|V|²).
