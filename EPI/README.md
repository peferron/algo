# Elements of Programming Interviews

The modules in this directory correspond to problems from the book [Elements of Programming Interviews](http://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com), version 1.5.9.

All modules are implemented in Swift or TypeScript.

Most of these modules could be written using generics, but this repo favors concrete types to avoid cluttering the code with `<T>`s.
