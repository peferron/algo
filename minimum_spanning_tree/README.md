# Minimum spanning tree

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree)

The implementations here use the most naïve version of [Prim's algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm). The resulting time complexity is O(nm), where n is the number of vertices and m the number of edges.
