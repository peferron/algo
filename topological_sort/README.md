# Topological sort

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting)

Time complexity: O(n + m), where n is the number of vertices and m the number of edges.

For an application of topological sort to find shortest paths in directed acyclic graphs, see module [dag_shortest_path](../dag_shortest_path).
