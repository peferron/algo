# Floyd–Warshall algorithm

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm)

* Suitable for finding shortest paths in directed or undirected weighted graphs with positive or negative edge weights but no negative cycles.
* Time complexity: O(n³).
* Space complexity: O(n²).

To find shortest paths in weighted directed acyclic graphs with positive or negative weights, see module [dag_shortest_path](../dag_shortest_path).

To find hortest paths in directed or undirected weighted graphs with positive weights only, see module [dijkstra](../dijkstra).
