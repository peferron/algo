* Suitable for finding shortest paths in weighted directed acyclic graphs with positive or negative weights.
* Time complexity: O(n + m), where n is the number of vertices and m the number of edges.

To find shortest paths in directed or undirected weighted graphs with positive weights only, see module [dijkstra](../dijkstra).

To find shortest paths in directed or undirected weighted graphs with positive or negative edge weights but no negative cycles, see module [floyd-warshall](../floyd-warshall).
