# Find Eulerian cycles

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path)

The algorithm implemented here is [Hierholzer's algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path#Hierholzer.27s_algorithm), with inspiration from [http://stones333.blogspot.com/2013/11/find-eulerian-path-in-directed-graph.html](http://stones333.blogspot.com/2013/11/find-eulerian-path-in-directed-graph.html).

This implementation is very naïve and runs in O(|E|²) instead of O(|E|).
