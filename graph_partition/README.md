# Graph partition

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_partition)

The heuristic used here is a naïve implementation of the [Kernighan–Lin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernighan%E2%80%93Lin_algorithm) algorithm, running in O(|V|³) time. Inline comments indicate how to bring it down to O(|V|² log |V|).
